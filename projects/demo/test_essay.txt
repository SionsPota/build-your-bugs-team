I think the biggest mistake people make when buying tech products is they don't think about the future. Many people just buy what looks good now, but technology changes very fast. For example, my friend bought a laptop last year that was very popular and had good reviews. But now, only one year later, the company released a new version with much better features. My friend feels like her laptop is already old, even though it still works fine. This makes her want to buy a new one, which wastes money.

Also, people often don't consider if the product will work with their other devices. I bought a smartwatch that was supposed to connect to my phone, but it only worked with certain types of phones. My phone was not compatible, so I couldn't use many of the watch's features. This was very frustrating because I spent a lot of money on something I couldn't fully use.

Another problem is that people trust advertisements too much. Advertisements always make products look perfect, but real users often have different experiences. I think people should read more reviews from actual customers before buying expensive tech products. Reviews can tell you about problems that advertisements don't mention.

In conclusion, I believe the biggest mistake is not planning for the future and not doing enough research before buying. People should think about how long they will use the product and whether it will still be useful in a few years.
