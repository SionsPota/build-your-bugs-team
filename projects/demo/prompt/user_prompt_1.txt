**Professor (Dr. Achebe):** This week we analyzed some aspects of current educational systems. One type of school system we discussed was boarding schools, which, as the name suggests, is a type of school where students live during the school year. I would like you to discuss whether you consider boarding schools beneficial for students' education or whether you think day schools, or schools where students do not live at the schools, are better for most students. Explain why you think so.

**Student 1 (Claire):** I would have loved to have attended a boarding school. I feel like boarding schools would have helped me establish a strict daily routine and helped me become more disciplined. Also, being in a boarding school means that you are with friends and classmates around the clock, and I would have loved such an opportunity.

**Student 2 (Andrew):** I personally do not support the boarding school system as I believe it can lead to many psychological problems. In fact, I have heard about what is referred to as "boarding school syndrome,” which, in simple terms, suggests that some students who attend boarding schools at a very young age can have long-term emotional or behavioral challenges. So why take that risk if most students can just go to day schools?

**[Student's Response to Evaluate]**

I am more inclined to agree that a boarding school system is beneficial. Firstly, a boarding school is a place where you can make friends with your classmates The "roommate" relationship is somewhat strong that you may remember forever, as you wake up, eat meals, study, and go to sleep together with your roommates on every school days. Secondly, a boarding school is usually close to your school campus, which means that you do not need to commute to and from school every day. Thirdly, a boarding school is not a place merely for a disciplined life; it often conducts various activities to help you get immersed in the living environment and make your life more colorful, which cannot be experienced at home. I personally do not agree with Andrew's point that boarding school places high mental pressure on students, as boarding schools are not prisons and students are still free to leave on weekends to bond with their family and pursue their interests.
