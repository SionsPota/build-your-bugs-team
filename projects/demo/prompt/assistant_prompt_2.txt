This response earned a score of 3. It is a partially successful contribution that is mostly relevant and understandable but does not display enough facility, variety, and elaboration to rise beyond 3. The writer argues in favor of boarding schools, indicating they provide routines, shared interests, and cultural exchange as well as educational focus and the sense of friendship. Some of these arguments are, however, not very well elaborated (what is “some good routine”? why are boarding schools suited to sharing things more than day schools?), and there are noticeable lexical and grammatical errors throughout the response: “is in the most interest,” “cause," "interest for commun things,” “discover other culture,” "can be more focus,” “they can count one on each other,” and others. The writing shows some lexical and grammatical variety and some facility, but not enough to earn a 4.
