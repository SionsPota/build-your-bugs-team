**Professor (Doctor Diaz):** This week, we will be looking at how consumers feel about their purchases of technology. Many people find that buying devices such as mobile phones or personal computers can be very difficult. They feel like they're not prepared to make the best decision to suit their needs. In your posts, I want you to discuss the following question: What do you believe is the biggest mistake that people make when buying tech products? Explain what this mistake is.

**Student 1 (Claire):** I think one problem is that people don't match the product's capabilities to their actual needs. My brother just got a new mobile phone, and he is very excited about how highly rated the camera is. But he hardly ever takes photos. So he paid for a feature that he doesn't really need.

**Student 2 (Paul):** When people buy a new piece of hardware, like a laptop, they often don't consider the software they are purchasing along with the hardware. If the software is not what you are used to or doesn't work with your existing files, it can be frustrating to learn a new way of using your laptop.

**[Student's Response to Evaluate]**

I agree with Claire that people buy things they don't need. But I think the biggest mistake is not reading reviews from other customers. Many people just trust advertisements or what the salesperson says. This is bad because advertisements always say good things about products, but real customers can tell you if there are problems. For example, my cousin bought a tablet because the advertisement said it was fast and had good battery. But when she got it, the battery died very quickly and it was slow. If she had read customer reviews online, she would have known about these problems before buying. Reviews from people who actually used the product are more honest than advertisements. So I think people should always check reviews before buying technology products.
