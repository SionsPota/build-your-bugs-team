STRENGTHS:

1. The response attempts to address the professor's question and presents a basic argument about overspending and unnecessary purchases.

2. The writer includes a personal example (friend's phone purchase) that relates to the topic.

END

WEAKNESSES:

1. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout, including missing articles ("make mistake," "buy tech"), incorrect verb forms ("buy" instead of "buys"), and sentence structure issues.

2. The vocabulary is severely limited, with repetitive and simple word choices.

3. The response lacks proper elaboration and development of ideas, making some points unclear or incomplete.

4. There are noticeable errors in word form and usage (e.g., "not need" instead of "don't need," "use what you have is better" instead of "using what you have is better").

END

OPPORTUNITIES:

1. The writer needs to improve grammatical accuracy, particularly with articles, verb forms, and sentence structure.

2. Expanding vocabulary and using more precise word choices would significantly enhance the response.

3. Developing ideas more fully with better elaboration and examples would strengthen the argument.

4. Improving sentence structure and using more complex grammatical forms would demonstrate greater language facility.

END

OVERVIEW:

This response earned a score of 2. It reflects an attempt to contribute to the discussion, but limitations in language use make the ideas difficult to follow at times. The response contains numerous grammatical errors, limited vocabulary, and lacks sufficient elaboration. While the writer presents a basic argument about overspending and includes a relevant example, the accumulation of errors in grammar, word form, and sentence structure prevents the response from achieving a higher score. The ideas are partially relevant but poorly expressed.
