STRENGTHS:

1. The response is relevant to the discussion and presents a clear, understandable argument about the importance of reading customer reviews.

2. The writer provides a concrete example (cousin's tablet purchase) that supports the main point effectively.

3. The response demonstrates basic facility with language and is generally easy to understand.

END

WEAKNESSES:

1. The language use is somewhat simple and repetitive, with limited syntactic variety (e.g., multiple sentences starting with "But" or "So").

2. Some word choices are basic or informal (e.g., "This is bad," "very quickly") and could be more precise or academic.

3. The argument, while clear, lacks the depth and sophistication seen in higher-scoring responses.

END

OPPORTUNITIES:

1. The writer could vary sentence structures more to demonstrate greater language facility.

2. Using more precise and academic vocabulary would enhance the quality of the response.

3. Expanding the analysis to connect the point to broader consumer behavior patterns would strengthen the argument.

END

OVERVIEW:

This response earned a score of 3. It is a partially successful contribution that is mostly relevant and understandable. The writer presents a clear argument about the importance of reading customer reviews, supported by a relevant example. However, the response displays limited syntactic variety and uses relatively simple vocabulary throughout. While the ideas are communicated effectively, the language lacks the sophistication and variety needed for a higher score. The response shows some facility with English but not enough to earn a 4.

END

SCORE:
