**Professor (Doctor Diaz):** This week, we will be looking at how consumers feel about their purchases of technology. Many people find that buying devices such as mobile phones or personal computers can be very difficult. They feel like they're not prepared to make the best decision to suit their needs. In your posts, I want you to discuss the following question: What do you believe is the biggest mistake that people make when buying tech products? Explain what this mistake is.

**Student 1 (Claire):** I think one problem is that people don't match the product's capabilities to their actual needs. My brother just got a new mobile phone, and he is very excited about how highly rated the camera is. But he hardly ever takes photos. So he paid for a feature that he doesn't really need.

**Student 2 (Paul):** When people buy a new piece of hardware, like a laptop, they often don't consider the software they are purchasing along with the hardware. If the software is not what you are used to or doesn't work with your existing files, it can be frustrating to learn a new way of using your laptop.

**[Student's Response to Evaluate]**

People make mistake when buy tech. They buy expensive things but not need. My friend buy phone very expensive but only use for call and message. Waste money. Also people buy new phone every year. Old phone still work but they want new one. This is big mistake. Should use old phone until broken. Save money and help environment. Technology change fast but not need buy every time. Use what you have is better.
