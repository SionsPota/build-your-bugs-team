This response earned a score of 5. The writer has composed a very clearly expressed contribution to the online discussion, demonstrating consistent facility in the use of language. The writer clearly states a preference for boarding schools and proceeds to provide several arguments explaining that preference. It praises the intense companionships with schoolmates that boarding schools offer, leaving a student with memories for a lifetime; it points out how boarding schools take commuting out of the equation and also how many varied activities they offer to their students. Finally, it takes issue with Andrew's concerns about psychological problems, explaining that boarding school students are not prisoners and can visit their families and bond with them on weekends. The writer uses an effective variety of structures and precise word choices, especially as the response moves past its opening sentences, and the few errors we can find at the beginning (“is somewhat strong that you remember” and “on every school days") can be expected from a very competent nonnative speaker writing under timed conditions that leave little time for editing and correcting all of one's slips and stumbles.
Note that high-level responses are not required to provide several arguments or reasons, as this response does. Many fully successful responses offer one extended argument or reason that is detailed and well elaborated.
