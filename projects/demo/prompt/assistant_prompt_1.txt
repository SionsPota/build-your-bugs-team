STRENGTHS:

1. The response demonstrates consistent facility in the use of language with an effective variety of syntactic structures and precise word choices, especially as the response moves past its opening sentences.

2. The writer clearly states a preference for boarding schools and provides several well-elaborated arguments, including the intense companionships with schoolmates that leave lasting memories, the elimination of commuting, and the variety of activities offered.

3. The response effectively engages with other students' points, specifically taking issue with Andrew's concerns about psychological problems by explaining that boarding school students are not prisoners and can visit their families on weekends.

4. The contribution is very clearly expressed and relevant to the online discussion, making it easy for readers to understand the writer's position and reasoning.

WEAKNESSES:

1. There are minor grammatical errors at the beginning of the response, such as "is somewhat strong that you remember" and "on every school days," though these are understandable given timed writing conditions.

OVERVIEW:

This response earned a score of 5. The writer has composed a very clearly expressed contribution to the online discussion, demonstrating consistent facility in the use of language. The response effectively presents multiple well-developed arguments in favor of boarding schools, engaging thoughtfully with the discussion context by addressing Andrew's concerns. While there are minor grammatical errors at the beginning, these do not detract from the overall clarity and effectiveness of the response. The few errors present can be expected from a very competent nonnative speaker writing under timed conditions that leave little time for editing. Note that high-level responses are not required to provide several arguments or reasons, as this response does. Many fully successful responses offer one extended argument or reason that is detailed and well elaborated.
