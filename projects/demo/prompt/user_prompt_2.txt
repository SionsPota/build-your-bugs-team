**Professor (Dr. Achebe):** This week we analyzed some aspects of current educational systems. One type of school system we discussed was boarding schools, which, as the name suggests, is a type of school where students live during the school year. I would like you to discuss whether you consider boarding schools beneficial for students' education or whether you think day schools, or schools where students do not live at the schools, are better for most students. Explain why you think so.

**Student 1 (Claire):** I would have loved to have attended a boarding school. I feel like boarding schools would have helped me establish a strict daily routine and helped me become more disciplined. Also, being in a boarding school means that you are with friends and classmates around the clock, and I would have loved such an opportunity.

**Student 2 (Andrew):** I personally do not support the boarding school system as I believe it can lead to many psychological problems. In fact, I have heard about what is referred to as "boarding school syndrome,” which, in simple terms, suggests that some students who attend boarding schools at a very young age can have long-term emotional or behavioral challenges. So why take that risk if most students can just go to day schools?

**[Student's Response to Evaluate]**

I think boarding school is in the most interest of the students, cause they can develop some good routine, learn from each other, share their interest for commun things, discover other culture. In boarding school, the students can be more focus on the school and have better grades. Boarding school can also help the students to develop their sense of friendship, they learn they can count one on eachother and they should help each other in every situation.
